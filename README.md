`tdmore` provides an easy interface for the execution of post-hoc bayesian
estimation of parameter vectors of virtual individuals given a population model and for the in silico assessment of dose individualization strategies.

The package is intended to make it easy to define your own models and use them for in silico assessments and educational purposes.
