## This file searches for all directories within "shinytest"
## and executes an appropriate testApp
##
## Some caveats
## 1) PhantomJS uses the QT library to render
## Different platforms will render differently (e.g. buttons are rendered differently on Linux vs Windows)
## 2) PhantomJS will compare the content of plots
## Because of #1, the plotting area may have a different size.
## Also, fonts may be different as well, which results in a different SHA1 hash for the PNG image.
## We recommend to *ignore* all plots, but instead to do one of the following
##    a) export the source data of the plot using exportTestValues()
##    b) use a htmlwidget (like plotly) to render the plot
