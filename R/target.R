# Target functions

## We want to be able to optimize the following values:
## Dose amount
## Dose rate
## Infusion time
## TAU (for a planned time of next dose)
## We need to mark which dosing events can be optimized

## Then the more tricky ones:
## How long should we wait before starting the next regimen?
## Should we skip the next dose?
## Should we add an extra loading dose to the next maintenance dose?
##

## This defines target functions to evaluate a specific dose suggestion
