It must be crystal clear that TDMore is a research tool only. TDMORE IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE, AND CANNOT BE USED WITHIN A PATIENT CARE SETTING. TDMore is a mathematical engine built for research only. If any TDMore software routines are included, used, connected or relied upon in any way by a software tool for bedside dosing advice or other patient care or diagnostics support, that software tool must be qualified under the appropriate Medical Device regulations.

TDMore and the TDMore development team are in no way liable for the result of using this software outside of its intended use. The TDMore team explicitly disclaims any liability when using the mathematical engine in a tool for patient care.
