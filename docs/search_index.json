Get started as quick as possible with tdmore, an R package that provides a global framework for making Therapeutic Drug Monitoring easy. You’ll get information on the package itself, its installation, interesting use cases and much more. Please note that this project does not include a license.

["preface.html", "Preface About this book Acknowledgements", " Preface TDMore provides an easy interface to execute post-hoc bayesian estimation of individual profiles, and to find the best dose to put the patient on target. The package is intended to make it easy to define your own models, and easily create a dose decision support tool for physicians. About this book This book provides guidance on the use of TDMore and serves as a basic reference manual. We assume that users have some notions in PK/PD modeling and simulation and are familiar with the R language. The installation of TDMore and related software and packages is described in Chapter 2. Acknowledgements We would like to thank all the people who are contributing to this project. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Prerequisites", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Prerequisites The TDMore framework is based on the R programming language, a free sofware environment for statistical computing. TDMore relies on a series of R open-source packages. In particular, it depends on: RxODE(An R package for simulating PK/PD models. This package is intensively used by TDMore to predict data) nlmixr(An R package for estimating PK/PD model parameters. Although TDMore also estimates model parameters, it does not rely on the nlmixr for the estimation part. However, this package is used for its nice way of defining PK/PD models.) More information on the installation of packages and software can be found in Chapter 2. "],
["install.html", "Chapter 2 Installation", " Chapter 2 Installation devtools::install_github(&quot;tdmore-dev/tdmore&quot;) We suggest you also install tidyverse and RxODE. The latter requires a working C and fortran compiler to work. "],
