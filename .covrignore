## We manage to cover all shinytests as well
## When using covr::package_coverage, the package is first installed in a temp location.
## Then, the package loader is modified to automatically instrument all code onLoad.
## As long as we ensure this instrumented package is used, all package code will indeed be tracked by covr,
## even if an external shinytest process is used.
##
## We do need to make sure that the shinytest process is gracefully terminated. This is not the case when
## using a regular app$stop()
## Any code in inst/ or other places is not tracked by covr. This should not be the goal anyway...
